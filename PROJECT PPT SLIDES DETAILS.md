📌 Slide 1: Introduction
	• Project Title: Detection of Jihadist Activity on Social Media Using Big Data
	• Objective: 
		○ Identify extremist activities on Twitter & social networks
		○ Classify users into risk categories using Fuzzy Clustering
		○ Analyze network influence & spread of propaganda
	• Technologies Used: 
		○ Big Data Processing: Apache Spark
		○ Graph Analysis: NetworkX
		○ Clustering Algorithms: Fuzzy C-Means, Gustafson-Kessel
		○ Machine Learning & NLP: Sentiment Analysis, Feature Engineering
		○ Database: MongoDB for storing classified user data
		○ API Layer: FastAPI for querying results

📌 Slide 2: Problem Statement
	• Why is this project important? 
		○ Social Media Exploitation: Extremist groups use Twitter for recruitment & propaganda.
		○ Traditional Monitoring Fails: Hard to detect hidden influencers & evolving tactics.
		○ Real-Time Threat Detection Needed: Large-scale streaming analysis of user behavior.
	• Challenges: 
		○ High-Volume Data – Requires efficient big data processing.
		○ Hidden Networks – Difficult to detect indirect influencers.
		○ Accuracy in Classification – Fuzzy clustering helps in non-binary risk detection.

📌 Slide 3: System Architecture
	• Components: 
		1. Data Ingestion Layer – Fetches Twitter data via API & Kaggle dataset.
		2. Processing Engine – Cleans & processes tweets for NLP analysis.
		3. Graph Analysis Layer – Builds a user influence network based on mentions/retweets.
		4. Clustering Engine – Uses Fuzzy C-Means & Gustafson-Kessel for classification.
		5. Database (MongoDB) – Stores classified users & metadata.
		6. API Gateway (FastAPI) – Allows querying of risk profiles.

📌 Slide 4: Data Collection & Preprocessing
	• Data Sources: 
		○ Kaggle Dataset: Pre-collected extremist tweets.
		○ Twitter API Streaming: Captures live tweet data & user activity.
		○ ISIS-affiliated forums: Helps identify relevant vocabulary & sentiment patterns.
	• Preprocessing Steps: 
		○ Remove bots, duplicate tweets, fake accounts.
		○ Extract mentions, retweets, follower counts.
		○ Perform sentiment analysis (VADER Lexicon).

📌 Slide 5: Graph-Based Social Network Analysis
	• Why Graphs? 
		○ Terrorist networks spread propaganda hierarchically.
		○ Social media connections help track influence & user interactions.
	• Graph Metrics Used: 
		○ Degree Centrality: Measures number of connections per user.
		○ Betweenness Centrality: Identifies "bridge users" who spread messages.
		○ Eigenvector Centrality: Detects high-impact users in the network.
	• Graph Visualization: 
		○ Networks show clusters of influential users spreading extremist content.

📌 Slide 6: Fuzzy Clustering for Risk Classification
	• Why Fuzzy Clustering? 
		○ Traditional models classify users as extremist/non-extremist.
		○ Fuzzy clustering assigns probability scores instead of binary labels.
	• Mathematical Formulation: 
		○ c: Number of clusters
		○ N: Number of data points
		○ m: Fuzziness parameter (>1)
		○ Jif: Membership degree of a data point in cluster j
	• Distance Measure Adjustments: 
		○ Adaptive Mahalanobis Distance for irregular cluster shapes.
		○ Gustafson-Kessel Algorithm for non-spherical clusters.

📌 Slide 7: Clustering Algorithm – Gustafson-Kessel
	• Why Use GK Algorithm? 
		○ Standard Fuzzy C-Means assumes spherical clusters.
		○ GK adapts cluster shapes dynamically to data distribution.
	• Algorithm Steps: 
		1. Compute Cluster Prototypes (Means)
		2. Calculate Covariance Matrices
		3. Compute Distances Between Users & Clusters
		4. Update Partition Matrix for fuzzy classification.

📌 Slide 8: Database & API Integration
	• MongoDB Schema: 
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "username": "JihadiUser",
  "followers_count": 500,
  "sentiment_score": -0.8,
  "eigenvector_centrality": 0.9,
  "risk_category": "High Risk"
}
	• FastAPI API Design: 
		○ GET /users/{risk_category} → Fetch all users in a given risk category.
		○ POST /analyze_tweet → Real-time sentiment & risk scoring.

📌 Slide 9: Deployment & Scalability
	• Docker Containers – Ensures reproducibility & scaling.
	• Kubernetes for Orchestration – Handles auto-scaling & load balancing.
	• Real-Time Streaming via Kafka – Continuous data collection & processing.
	• Monitoring & Logging: 
		○ Grafana & Prometheus for performance tracking.
		○ ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis.

📌 Slide 10: Results & Evaluation
	• Cluster Validation Metrics: 
		○ Optimal Clusters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
		○ Best Fuzzy Partition Coefficient (FPC): 
			§ 2 Clusters → FPC = 0.95
			§ 3 Clusters → FPC = 0.86
			§ 4 Clusters → FPC = 0.80
			§ 6 Clusters → FPC = 0.54
	• Findings: 
		○ Red Cluster → High-Risk Users
		○ Blue Cluster → Neutral Users
		○ Borderline Cases → Monitored for behavioral changes

📌 Slide 11: Future Enhancements
	• Deep Learning for NLP: 
		○ Use BERT or GPT models for advanced sentiment & intent detection.
	• Integration with Government Agencies: 
		○ Build API access for law enforcement to flag high-risk users.
	• Fake News & Misinformation Tracking: 
		○ Expand analysis to fake news networks and extremist propaganda.
